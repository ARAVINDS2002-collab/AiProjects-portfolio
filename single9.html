							<p> The main operations in the app include rotating images, mirroring them, converting them to black and white, and sharpening them. When the user chooses to rotate an image to the left, the code rotates the image by 90 degrees counterclockwise, and when rotating right, it rotates the image by 90 degrees clockwise. The mirror operation uses the ImageOps.mirror() function to create a horizontally flipped version of the image, effectively creating a mirror reflection. The black and white operation converts the image to grayscale, removing all color information and leaving a range of gray shades using the ImageOps.grayscale() function. Finally, the sharpen operation enhances the edges in the image, making them appear more distinct by applying the ImageFilter.SHARPEN filter. Each of these operations transforms the image in a specific way, and the modified image is then displayed on the app's canvas. If the user wants to revert the image back to its original state, the app has a revert function that reloads the original image, undoing all previous modifications. This allows users to experiment with different effects on their images and easily return to the starting point if needed. The code ensures that the image is always resized to fit the canvas while maintaining the aspect ratio, so the image is displayed properly regardless of the canvas size. These operations give the app its core functionality, allowing users to interactively edit their images with just a few clicks.</p>
